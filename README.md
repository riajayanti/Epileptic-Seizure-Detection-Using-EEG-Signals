# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection-Using-EEG-Signals 

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide, characterized by recurrent seizures caused by abnormal and excessive electrical brain activity. These seizures can be unpredictable, leading to brain damage, physical injury, severe depression, anxiety, and even death. The condition affects approximately 50 million people globally, and while up to 70% of those affected could potentially become seizure-free with proper medical diagnosis and treatment, nearly 80% live in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that 75% of people with epilepsy who live in low-income countries do not receive adequate medical treatment (World Health Organization, 2024). Therefore, it is imperative that at-home seizure detection and prediction technology becomes more accessible, particularly in underserved regions. This research utilizes the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, applying machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine) for seizure detection, along with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time-series forecasting for seizure prediction. To address the significant class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed, increasing the percentage of seizure samples in the dataset from 0.23% to 50.00%. The Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine models both achieved 100% accuracy and recall for seizure detection, and the LSTM model achieved 89.26% accuracy and 89% weighted recall for seizure prediction. This research demonstrates the potential of AI-driven methods to be integrated into at-home seizure-monitoring devices, making seizure detection and prediction technology significantly more accessible.
